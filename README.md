## jsfiddle Console

Simple console emulator for [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). **jsfiddle Console** emulates either `console.log` and `console.error`. You just need to add the following URL to `External Resources` in jsfiddle, then you will see `console.log` and `console.error` in the result screen.
